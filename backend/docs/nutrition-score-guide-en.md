# Understanding Nutrition Scores

## How to Interpret Your Nutrition Score

The nutrition score in the UQIFeed app evaluates how well a food aligns with your nutritional needs. It's important to understand that **this score compares a single food item against your FULL daily nutritional requirements**.

### Score Ratings

- **90-100**: Excellent - This food perfectly matches your nutritional needs
- **80-89**: Very Good - This food is a great match for your nutritional needs
- **70-79**: Good - This food is a good match for your nutritional needs
- **60-69**: Fair - This food is an acceptable match for your nutritional needs
- **50-59**: Moderate - This food somewhat matches your nutritional needs, but there is room for improvement
- **40-49**: Poor - This food does not align well with your nutritional needs
- **30-39**: Very Poor - This food is not recommended for your nutritional needs
- **0-29**: Unsuitable - This food does not match your nutritional needs at all

## Average Scores Are Normal!

It's important to note that **most individual food items will score in the moderate range (40-70)** because:

1. Most individual foods only make up a small portion of your total daily nutritional needs.
2. Different foods have different nutritional profiles and are designed to complement each other.
3. A balanced diet requires a variety of different foods.

### Real-world Examples

- **Grilled lamb ribs**: Score 58/100 (Moderate) - High in protein but low in carbs and fiber
- **Vegetable salad**: Score 45/100 (Poor) - High in fiber but low in protein and calories
- **White rice**: Score 40/100 (Poor) - High in carbs but low in protein and fiber

When these three items are combined in a meal, they can form a balanced meal with a higher score.

## How to Use Scores Effectively

### For Individual Foods

1. **Compare within food categories**: Compare scores of meats with other meats, vegetables with other vegetables, etc.
2. **Check the detailed nutrition**: Look at the detailed information to see what your food is lacking or exceeding
3. **Evaluate by meal type**: If you're eating this food as breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack, consider the appropriate proportion

### For Complete Meals

Ideally, you should combine foods to create a balanced meal:

- **Protein sources**: Meat, fish, beans, eggs
- **Carbohydrate sources**: Rice, noodles, potatoes
- **Fiber and vitamins**: Vegetables, fruits
- **Healthy fats**: Olive oil, avocados, nuts

## Conclusion

Nutrition scores are a useful tool to evaluate how well foods match your nutritional needs, but they shouldn't be the only factor considered. Use the detailed information about each nutritional component to create a balanced and diverse diet.
